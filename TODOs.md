# TODOs
* uci info output of evaluated moves
* debug output statistics for minmax search
    * number of computed possible successors
    * max reached depth
    * average reached depth
    * average branching factor
    * actually visited nodes
    * number of times of alpha/beta pruning
* iterative deepening
* uci tournament mode
* use machine learning to prioritize and select moves
    * train model using publicly available game logs
* use machine learning to evaluate terminal position
* reinforcement learning
